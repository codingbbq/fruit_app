# Fruit APP UI - Developed in Flutter

- We try to build a UI in flutter based on the [dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/6439039-Fruit-App) design.

- All the images used during development of the flutter application are downloaded from [Stickpng](https://www.stickpng.com/)

Below screenshots are the final output seen on the Android emulator. I had fun developing the UI in flutter.
